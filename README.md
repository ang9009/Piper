# Piper

Simple course sniper extension for NEU students. Please note that this has not
been tested yet, so I have no idea if it will actually work during registration
day.

## Usage

- Install the extension and pin it
- Fill in your registration time, term, and plan name
- Submit, and have the course selection page on Banner open (preferably before
  registration time for best results). Piper will remind you 5 minutes before
  the deadline + open the page for you if you still don't have it open by then,
  but this will cause some delay
